Use this snapshot as the source of truth for exact OHLCV, price-level, and indicator-value claims. If another tool output conflicts with it, flag the discrepancy rather than inventing a reconciled number. Do not claim historical validation, support/resistance bounces, or exact percentage moves unless directly supported by tool output with concrete dates and prices.
